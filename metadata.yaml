description: Pepys' original diary was written in shorthand between 1660 and 1669
  and not deciphered until 1825. These selections reveal in an engaging fashion the
  public and private life of a most interesting, active, articulate Englishman and
  his lively French wife and provide valuable information about the period in which
  they lived.
